                            The most dangerous moment for a business is when
                            things are going well. That's when you're most blind
                            to disruption. Become paranoid. Question everything.
                            Write your business model's eulogy. And remember
                            Kodak: having the technology isn't enough—you need
                            the courage to cannibalize your cash cow before
