                            from bad ideas, but from organizational antibodies.
                            De-risk ruthlessly through rapid testing. Lead
                            visibly from the top. Involve employees early. Fight
                            cognitive biases. And remember: innovate when times
                            are good, because waiting for crisis is waiting too
                            long. Don't be the fat smoker who knows what to do
