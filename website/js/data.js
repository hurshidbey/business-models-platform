  {
    "id": 1,
    "name": "Add-On",
    "image": "01-add-on.png",
    "howItWorks": "The core product is priced competitively, but numerous extra features or services (add-ons) increase the final price. Customers can customize the product to their needs (WHAT?). The revenue from hefty premiums on optional features drives up profit (VALUE?). This model uses a sophisticated pricing strategy where the core product is advertised at a very low rate.",
    "origin": "The concept of additional offers has existed for a long time. Industrialization helped create modular products allowing for extras. The tourism industry adopted this model, with cruise lines selling basic transport cheaply and charging premiums for add-ons like better rooms and excursions.",
    "examples": "Ryanair (1985): Offers cheap basic airfares while charging for extras like baggage and meals. Bosch Engineering GmbH (1999): Offers standard hardware for electronic control units and sells customization software as a separate service. Tesla (2003): Offers performance add-ons via software updates after purchase. SAP (1992): Sells its standard business suite at a moderate price while encouraging clients to buy additional applications.",
    "whoFor": "This is well-suited for markets where customer preferences diverge vastly. It is standard in the car industry. It works in B2B for bundling low-margin core products with high-margin extras. It can also help technologies break through by cross-subsidizing them."
  },
  {
    "id": 2,
    "name": "Affiliation",
    "image": "02-affiliation.png",
    "howItWorks": "The company supports other parties (affiliates) to market products, gaining access to a diversified customer base without extra marketing efforts. When a customer makes a purchase, the referring reseller is identified (HOW?) and receives a commission (VALUE?). For resellers like blogs or price comparison sites, this can be the central revenue model.",
    "origin": "Its origins trace back to the emergence of the Internet. PC Flowers & Gifts had an active affiliate program by 1995. It is likely that adult sites pioneered this concept in the early 1990s, offering high commissions.",
    "examples": "Amazon (1995): Popularized the model with its Amazon.com Associates Program, granting partners 4–10% of turnover. Pinterest (2010): Uses affiliate identifiers when users pin items for sale, generating commissions. Wirecutter (2011): Charges a commission for every recommended product a user purchases through a click.",
    "whoFor": "This model requires a strong ecosystem and passionate customers. It creates a win-win situation because merchants only incur costs when sales are generated, and affiliates are motivated by financial rewards. It is an excellent choice if a company cannot afford a direct sales force."
  },
  {
    "id": 3,
    "name": "Aikido",
    "image": "03-aikido.png",
    "howItWorks": "Inspired by the Japanese martial art, this model involves offering products or services that are radically different from the industry standard (WHAT?). The company occupies a position opposite to its competitors, turning their strengths into weaknesses. This differentiation attracts customers who prefer concepts opposed to the mainstream.",
    "origin": "The concept dates back to antiquity (e.g., David and Goliath). In business, Six Flags (1961) was an early adopter, focusing on regional themes and easy access, contrasting with national parks like Disneyland.",
    "examples": "The Body Shop (1976): Rejected glamorous ads, sold environmentally friendly products, and campaigned against animal testing. Swatch (1983): Offered moderately priced, high-quality designer watches as fashion accessories, contrasting with the luxury Swiss watch industry. Cirque du Soleil (1984): Combined theater and circus arts, avoiding costly features like animal performances to appeal to adults.",
    "whoFor": "Applying Aikido demands courage and out-of-the-box thinking. It can work in any industry. Success relies on identifying a competitor's strengths and finding an opposing strategy that renders them irrelevant. Market checks are crucial."
  },
  {
    "id": 4,
    "name": "Auction",
    "image": "04-auction.png",
    "howItWorks": "The model uses participative pricing where the price is influenced by buyers through bidding. The highest bidder purchases the item. The customer benefits by never paying more than they are willing to afford (WHAT?). The vendor benefits from efficient product allocation (VALUE?), which is especially valuable for rare or hard-to-price products. A variant is the reverse auction, where vendors bid for a contract.",
    "origin": "Auctions are an age-old model, commercialized by houses like Sotheby’s (1744). The Internet expanded their reach. eBay (1995) became the largest global online auction house.",
    "examples": "Priceline (1997): Implemented a reverse auction for travel services where customers submit their maximum price. MyHammer (2005): Uses reverse auctions for tradespeople. Google Ads (2003): Uses a theoretical auction system based on advertiser bid and ad quality to determine ad placement.

    "id": 5,
    "name": "Barter",
    "image": "05-barter.png",
    "howItWorks": "This model involves the direct exchange of products or services for goods or services in kind, without any monetary transaction (VALUE?). It can boost a brand by cost-effectively introducing new potential customers to products (WHAT?). The exchange relies on the differing perceived value of the goods/services by each party.",

    "examples": "Procter & Gamble (P&G) (1970): Sponsored \\\"soap operas\\\" in exchange for advertising and gives away free Pampers in maternity wards. Lufthansa (1993): Bartered unused retail space for airtime. Magnolia Hotels (2007): Trades room nights for goods or services. \\\"Pay with a Tweet\\\" (2010): Provides a free product in exchange for a user tweeting about it.",
    "whoFor": "This pattern is valuable for businesses with complementary partners. It enables mutually beneficial goals, such as acquiring new customers. It works well when external assets (like unused capacity) can be exchanged for necessary goods or services."
  },
  {
    "id": 6,
    "name": "Cash Machine",
    "image": "06-cash-machine.png",
    "howItWorks": "This model operates with a negative cash conversion cycle, meaning the company collects cash from customers faster than it pays suppliers. This generates additional liquidity (VALUE?) for investments or growth. Key levers are negotiating generous payment terms with suppliers (HOW?) and ensuring prompt payment from customers.",
    "origin": "The principle has existed for a long time. American Express (1891) pioneered a model based on this with traveler’s cheques, generating interest on the funds held (the 'float').",
    "examples": "Dell (1984): Achieved a highly negative cash conversion cycle through its build-to-order strategy. Amazon (1994): Uses this pattern effectively through rapid inventory turnover and generous supplier terms. PayPal (1998): Earns interest on user funds held and receives upfront fees for payment processing.",
    "whoFor": "This pattern is suitable if a business builds to order or has the bargaining power to negotiate favorable payment conditions. It provides crucial liquidity but is only feasible if the offering has a high perceived value for customers."
  },
  {
    "id": 7,
    "name": "Cross-Selling",
    "image": "07-cross-selling.png",
    "howItWorks": "This involves offering complementary products and services beyond a company’s primary offering (WHAT?), exploiting existing customer relationships to maximize sales. It leverages existing resources like sales and marketing (HOW?, VALUE?). Customers benefit from the convenience of purchasing multiple related products from a single source (WHAT?).",
    "origin": "The practice was used by merchants in ancient bazaars. Royal Dutch Shell (1930s) was a modern pioneer, selling unrelated goods like groceries at its petrol stations.",
    "examples": "IKEA (1956): Boosts sales by offering complementary services like in-store restaurants and car rentals. Aldi (1986): Uses rotational campaigns to sell non-grocery items like laptops. Zalando (2008): Suggests complementary items (\\\"Complete the look\\\"). Booking.com (1996): Suggests related travel services after a booking.",
    "whoFor": "Cross-Selling holds great potential when a low-margin core product can be bundled with high-margin complementary products. In B2B, it is used to bundle specialized products or services to meet customer demand for one-stop solutions."
  },
  {
    "id": 8,
    "name": "Crowdfunding",
    "image": "08-crowdfunding.png",
    "howItWorks": "This model outsources the financing of a project to the general public (the \\\"crowd\\\"), typically via an online platform (HOW?). Project creators gain access to a broad pool of investors (VALUE?). Backers typically receive project-specific rewards in return (HOW?). Funding often operates on an all-or-nothing basis, reducing risk.",
    "origin": "The practice dates back to antiquity. The modern era began when the band Marillion (1997) used an online campaign to finance its US tour.",
    "examples": "Cassava Films (1998): Funded post-production of its film. diaspora (2010):* A non-profit social network that raised $200,000 on Kickstarter.

  },
  {
    "id": 9,
    "name": "Crowdsourcing",
    "image": "09-crowdsourcing.png",
    "howItWorks": "This involves outsourcing specific tasks or problems to an anonymous external crowd, usually via an open call (HOW?). The aim is to tap into external knowledge to develop solutions more effectively and cheaply (VALUE?). Contributors may be motivated by monetary rewards or personal interest. If an idea is chosen, the contributor receives a reward.",
    "origin": "The term was coined in 2006, but the historical root is seen in initiatives like the British Longitude Act of 1714, which offered a reward for solving the longitude problem.",
    "examples": "Cisco (2007): Uses its \\\"I-Prize\\\" competition to procure innovative business proposals. McDonald’s (2014): Asked customers to submit burger recipes for public voting. Airbnb (2015): Crowdsourced authentic marketing videos. InnoCentive (2001): A platform where companies post R&D challenges with financial rewards.",

    "name": "Customer Loyalty",
    "image": "10-customer-loyalty.png",
    "howItWorks": "This model retains customers by offering incentives beyond the basic transaction (e.g., reward programs, discounts). The system reduces the incentive for customers to switch to competitors. Crucially, the model allows the company to track purchasing behavior and gather valuable data (WHY?), which is used to optimize offerings and marketing.",
    "origin": "The pattern is over 200 years old. Sperry & Hutchinson (1897) was a pioneer, providing Green Shield Stamps redeemable for catalogue products.",

    "origin": "It emerged from the Open Innovation movement, gaining popularity with Web 2.0. Threadless (2000) was an early creator: an online community submitted T-shirt designs for public voting, with winning designers receiving rewards.",
    "examples": "LEGO (2005): Established LEGO Factory, providing online tools for customers to create and sell custom toy sets. Ponoko (2007): Allows customers to design products and sell them via its online store. Other examples include platforms for user-designed shoes (Dream Heels) and tattoos (Create My Tattoo).",
    "whoFor": "Promising in industries with comparatively simple products highly dependent on design. It taps into the desire for interactivity within social communities. It provides access to innovative designs and helps build a community of engaged customers."

    "name": "White Label",
    "image": "55-white-label.png",
    "howItWorks": "The producer manufactures goods without a specific brand name and allows different marketing companies or retailers to distribute them under their own brand.",
    "origin": "The name originates from the music industry (second half of the 20th century), where unlabelled demo records (\\\"white labels\\\") were sent out to gauge reaction. The model was later adopted by the food industry.",
    "examples": "Foxconn (1974): A major WL producer, manufacturing electronic devices for brands like Apple and Dell. CEWE (1997): Provides photo printing services sold under the brand names of distributors. Richelieu Foods (1994): A contract food producer that customizes manufacturing for retail chains' own brands.",
    "whoFor": "Suitable if the company has an established brand but needs to reach price-sensitive customers. It works well in industries characterized by large sales volumes and small margins (e.g., food, garments)."

    "howItWorks": "The company offers services derived from data gathered via sensors (WHAT?) embedded in physical offerings. Data is generated by company-owned, customer-owned, or third-party sensors (HOW?). The primary revenue is from the service enabled by the analysis of this information, not the sensor sale itself (VALUE?).",
    "origin": "[No information provided]",
    "examples": "Theline (2005): Installs sensors to detect vacant parking places, selling the processed data to consumers via mobile apps. Google Nest (2011): Uses sensor data from its self-learning thermostat to create optimized schedules, collaborating with energy providers.",
    "whoFor": "Ideal for companies proficient in handling large amounts of data while possessing expertise in the physical world. Also attractive to players with access to many data points. Suitable for creating profitable after-sales markets."

    "name": "Virtualisation",
    "image": "57-virtualisation.png",
    "howItWorks": "This model involves imitating a traditionally physical process (e.g., storage, workspaces) in a virtual environment (HOW?). The customer benefits from the ability to interact with the service from any location (WHAT?). The service is often paid for via access fees.",
    "origin": "The concept is a logical consequence of increasing digitalisation and ubiquitous internet access.",
    "examples": "Amazon WorkSpaces (2006): Virtualizes desktops to the cloud, allowing employees to access their synchronized workstations from any device. DUFL (2015): Virtualized clothes storage and transportation, allowing travelers to pack online and have their clothes await them at their destination.",
    "whoFor": "Suitable for services where multi-device access is necessary, where additional value can be added digitally, or where physical distance is a roadblock. It is an effective way to complement established offerings."

This removes time-consuming activities from the customer (WHAT?). The firm secures recurrent revenue (VALUE?).",
    "origin": "The concept has been developed based on IoT technologies and the vision of autonomous objects becoming a reality.",
    "examples": "[Example]: A smart refrigerator collaborating with external chefs to optimize food refills. HP Instant Ink (2013): Uses compatible printers to autonomously order new ink cartridges when current ones are low, providing a carefree package with a Flat Rate plan.",
    "whoFor": "Especially useful in professional environments where time is crucial and processes are standardized. It prevents material shortcomings and can enhance Lock-In potential for well-known suppliers."

    "image": "59-object-as-point-of-sale.png",
    "howItWorks": "The point of sale for consumables is moved to the point of consumption using internet-connected devices (HOW?). This physical proximity makes the customer less sensitive to price, generating stronger Lock-In. Sensors measure consumption needs, allowing optimization of offers for complementary goods.",
    "origin": "Derived from the vision of the Internet of Things (IoT).",
    "examples": "Amazon Dash Button (2015): Small Wi-Fi connected devices that allow customers to reorder a specific product with a single press.",
    "whoFor": "Suitable for consumables and goods used constantly where consumption fluctuates. Since the customer still makes the final decision, additional mechanisms (e.g., digital ads) are needed to convert the impulse into a purchase."

    "howItWorks": "The company enables customers to become producers themselves. The customer is integrated into the value chain (HOW?) and can profit from the resulting product. The firm reduces investment costs for production (VALUE?). The consumer's active role in production increases the perceived value of the product (WHAT?).",
    "origin": "Based on Alvin Toffler’s definition in The Third Wave (1980s). Early instances were seen in the Self-Help Cooperative Movements (1930s), where unemployed workers worked on farms in exchange for food.",
    "examples": "[No examples provided in text]",
    "whoFor": "Fits well with platform business models and organizations that provide infrastructure flexible enough to integrate customers as resources or suppliers. Success requires balancing incentives for Prosumers with the company's own value capture."
