                            Before you can innovate, you must understand your
                            current business model architecture. Map your four
                            pillars honestly. Then, when you're ready to
                            innovate, remember: change at least two dimensions
                            simultaneously, or you're not really innovating your
                            business model—you're just tweaking your product.
