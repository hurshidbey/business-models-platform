Business Model,How it works?,Where it Comes from?,Examples,Who is it for?
Add-On,"The core product is priced competitively, but numerous extra features or services (add-ons) increase the final price. Customers can customize the product to their needs (WHAT?). The revenue from hefty premiums on optional features drives up profit (VALUE?). This model uses a sophisticated pricing strategy where the core product is advertised at a very low rate.","The concept of additional offers has existed for a long time. Industrialization helped create modular products allowing for extras. The tourism industry adopted this model, with cruise lines selling basic transport cheaply and charging premiums for add-ons like better rooms and excursions.",Ryanair (1985): Offers cheap basic airfares while charging for extras like baggage and meals. Bosch Engineering GmbH (1999): Offers standard hardware for electronic control units and sells customization software as a separate service. Tesla (2003): Offers performance add-ons via software updates after purchase. SAP (1992): Sells its standard business suite at a moderate price while encouraging clients to buy additional applications.,This is well-suited for markets where customer preferences diverge vastly. It is standard in the car industry. It works in B2B for bundling low-margin core products with high-margin extras. It can also help technologies break through by cross-subsidizing them.
Affiliation,"The company supports other parties (affiliates) to market products, gaining access to a diversified customer base without extra marketing efforts. When a customer makes a purchase, the referring reseller is identified (HOW?) and receives a commission (VALUE?). For resellers like blogs or price comparison sites, this can be the central revenue model.","Its origins trace back to the emergence of the Internet. PC Flowers & Gifts had an active affiliate program by 1995. It is likely that adult sites pioneered this concept in the early 1990s, offering high commissions.","Amazon (1995): Popularized the model with its Amazon.com Associates Program, granting partners 4–10% of turnover. Pinterest (2010): Uses affiliate identifiers when users pin items for sale, generating commissions. Wirecutter (2011): Charges a commission for every recommended product a user purchases through a click.","This model requires a strong ecosystem and passionate customers. It creates a win-win situation because merchants only incur costs when sales are generated, and affiliates are motivated by financial rewards. It is an excellent choice if a company cannot afford a direct sales force."
Aikido,"Inspired by the Japanese martial art, this model involves offering products or services that are radically different from the industry standard (WHAT?). The company occupies a position opposite to its competitors, turning their strengths into weaknesses. This differentiation attracts customers who prefer concepts opposed to the mainstream.","The concept dates back to antiquity (e.g., David and Goliath). In business, Six Flags (1961) was an early adopter, focusing on regional themes and easy access, contrasting with national parks like Disneyland.","The Body Shop (1976): Rejected glamorous ads, sold environmentally friendly products, and campaigned against animal testing. Swatch (1983): Offered moderately priced, high-quality designer watches as fashion accessories, contrasting with the luxury Swiss watch industry. Cirque du Soleil (1984): Combined theater and circus arts, avoiding costly features like animal performances to appeal to adults.",Applying Aikido demands courage and out-of-the-box thinking. It can work in any industry. Success relies on identifying a competitor's strengths and finding an opposing strategy that renders them irrelevant. Market checks are crucial.
Auction,"The model uses participative pricing where the price is influenced by buyers through bidding. The highest bidder purchases the item. The customer benefits by never paying more than they are willing to afford (WHAT?). The vendor benefits from efficient product allocation (VALUE?), which is especially valuable for rare or hard-to-price products. A variant is the reverse auction, where vendors bid for a contract.","Auctions are an age-old model, commercialized by houses like Sotheby’s (1744). The Internet expanded their reach. eBay (1995) became the largest global online auction house.",Priceline (1997): Implemented a reverse auction for travel services where customers submit their maximum price. MyHammer (2005): Uses reverse auctions for tradespeople. Google Ads (2003): Uses a theoretical auction system based on advertiser bid and ad quality to determine ad placement. Auctionmaxx (2012): Liquidates unclaimed freight online without reserve prices.,The Auction pattern is highly scalable and flexible. It is useful for increasing transparency for standardized products or for selling highly specialized products if sufficient traffic can be attracted.
Barter,"This model involves the direct exchange of products or services for goods or services in kind, without any monetary transaction (VALUE?). It can boost a brand by cost-effectively introducing new potential customers to products (WHAT?). The exchange relies on the differing perceived value of the goods/services by each party.","The roots of Barter date back to antiquity. In the modern business world, the concept gained traction after the 1960s.","Procter & Gamble (P&G) (1970): Sponsored ""soap operas"" in exchange for advertising and gives away free Pampers in maternity wards. Lufthansa (1993): Bartered unused retail space for airtime. Magnolia Hotels (2007): Trades room nights for goods or services. ""Pay with a Tweet"" (2010): Provides a free product in exchange for a user tweeting about it.","This pattern is valuable for businesses with complementary partners. It enables mutually beneficial goals, such as acquiring new customers. It works well when external assets (like unused capacity) can be exchanged for necessary goods or services."
Cash Machine,"This model operates with a negative cash conversion cycle, meaning the company collects cash from customers faster than it pays suppliers. This generates additional liquidity (VALUE?) for investments or growth. Key levers are negotiating generous payment terms with suppliers (HOW?) and ensuring prompt payment from customers.","The principle has existed for a long time. American Express (1891) pioneered a model based on this with traveler’s cheques, generating interest on the funds held (the 'float').",Dell (1984): Achieved a highly negative cash conversion cycle through its build-to-order strategy. Amazon (1994): Uses this pattern effectively through rapid inventory turnover and generous supplier terms. PayPal (1998): Earns interest on user funds held and receives upfront fees for payment processing.,This pattern is suitable if a business builds to order or has the bargaining power to negotiate favorable payment conditions. It provides crucial liquidity but is only feasible if the offering has a high perceived value for customers.
Cross-Selling,"This involves offering complementary products and services beyond a company’s primary offering (WHAT?), exploiting existing customer relationships to maximize sales. It leverages existing resources like sales and marketing (HOW?, VALUE?). Customers benefit from the convenience of purchasing multiple related products from a single source (WHAT?).","The practice was used by merchants in ancient bazaars. Royal Dutch Shell (1930s) was a modern pioneer, selling unrelated goods like groceries at its petrol stations.","IKEA (1956): Boosts sales by offering complementary services like in-store restaurants and car rentals. Aldi (1986): Uses rotational campaigns to sell non-grocery items like laptops. Zalando (2008): Suggests complementary items (""Complete the look""). Booking.com (1996): Suggests related travel services after a booking.","Cross-Selling holds great potential when a low-margin core product can be bundled with high-margin complementary products. In B2B, it is used to bundle specialized products or services to meet customer demand for one-stop solutions."
Crowdfunding,"This model outsources the financing of a project to the general public (the ""crowd""), typically via an online platform (HOW?). Project creators gain access to a broad pool of investors (VALUE?). Backers typically receive project-specific rewards in return (HOW?). Funding often operates on an all-or-nothing basis, reducing risk.",The practice dates back to antiquity. The modern era began when the band Marillion (1997) used an online campaign to finance its US tour.,"Cassava Films (1998): Funded post-production of its film. diaspora (2010):* A non-profit social network that raised $200,000 on Kickstarter. Sono Motors (2016): Raised over €6 million on Seedrs for its solar-powered car. Modern Dayfarer (2018): Used Kickstarter to fund its backpack via pre-orders.",This model is a source of zero-interest financial resources and allows entrepreneurs to validate ideas early. It is advantageous for projects that are emotionally oriented or have high public interest. It provides valuable feedback from interested participants.
Crowdsourcing,"This involves outsourcing specific tasks or problems to an anonymous external crowd, usually via an open call (HOW?). The aim is to tap into external knowledge to develop solutions more effectively and cheaply (VALUE?). Contributors may be motivated by monetary rewards or personal interest. If an idea is chosen, the contributor receives a reward.","The term was coined in 2006, but the historical root is seen in initiatives like the British Longitude Act of 1714, which offered a reward for solving the longitude problem.","Cisco (2007): Uses its ""I-Prize"" competition to procure innovative business proposals. McDonald’s (2014): Asked customers to submit burger recipes for public voting. Airbnb (2015): Crowdsourced authentic marketing videos. InnoCentive (2001): A platform where companies post R&D challenges with financial rewards.",Applicable to almost any company's ideation phase. It works best for companies that wish to leverage external innovation potential. It is vital to frame the problem specifically enough for the crowd to provide relevant input.
Customer Loyalty,"This model retains customers by offering incentives beyond the basic transaction (e.g., reward programs, discounts). The system reduces the incentive for customers to switch to competitors. Crucially, the model allows the company to track purchasing behavior and gather valuable data (WHY?), which is used to optimize offerings and marketing.","The pattern is over 200 years old. Sperry & Hutchinson (1897) was a pioneer, providing Green Shield Stamps redeemable for catalogue products.","American Airlines (1981): Introduced AAdvantage, one of the first frequent flyer programs. Payback (2000): Tracks purchasing behavior across partner firms for targeted advertising. Starbucks (2010): Integrated its bonus program into its mobile app to centralize customer and transaction data.","This model has become a necessity for long-term success, especially in competitive industries. It is suitable for businesses aiming to develop an emotional relationship with customers and drive brand identification."
Digitalisation,"This involves converting an existing physical product or service into an intangible digital variant. It makes offerings highly reliable and efficient, allowing processes to be relocated to the Internet (HOW?). It enables faster scaling and access to new customer groups (WHO?). The company can create new forms of content (WHAT?) and adopt new value-capturing mechanisms (VALUE?).",This model is relatively recent. Early electronic services appeared in the 1980s. The development of broadband Internet and GUIs in the 1990s catalyzed widespread digitalization.,"WXYC (1994): A college radio station that broadcast its programs over the Internet. Hotmail (1996): Offered webmail service, with the free basic account cross-financed by premium features. Amazon Kindle (2007): Digitalized reading content, enabling users to wirelessly buy and read e-books.","Ideal for data and knowledge-driven products, especially those that are time-critical (e.g., news). It is crucial for maximizing value proposition using Internet infrastructure. The convergence of physical and digital worlds suggests further potential."
Direct Selling,"The manufacturer sells products directly to the customer, bypassing intermediaries (HOW?). This eliminates the retail margin, which can be passed on to the customer (VALUE?). It enables a personal sales experience and helps the company better understand customer needs (WHAT?). It allows the company to maintain control over distribution (HOW?, VALUE?).","As one of the oldest distribution forms, modern iterations began with industrial goods. German company Vorwerk (1930s) pioneered modern Direct Selling for its vacuum cleaners.","Tupperware (1946): Introduced ""Tupperware parties,"" selling kitchenware through representatives at customers' homes. Hilti (1941): A successful B2B direct vendor where most employees are dedicated to sales, dealing personally with professional customers.","Applicable for any company seeking to cut out middlemen. It is effective when the increase in customer intimacy and process control is highly valuable, compensating for high sales costs. It helps control the entire sales process."
E-commerce,"Products are sold and delivered via online channels. Customers benefit from easy searching, price comparison, and convenience. E-commerce encompasses buying and selling electronically, plus customer service (WHAT?, HOW?). It enables global reach with minimal additional costs (VALUE?) and increases market transparency.","E-commerce has evolved over 60 years, beginning with electronic data transmission in the late 1940s. The widespread adoption of the internet facilitated the move toward consumer-facing platforms.",Amazon (1994): Revolutionized retail E-commerce. Asos (2000): A major online retailer for fashion. Alibaba Group (1999): Operates a digital ecosystem with B2B/B2C trading and payment services. Otto (2018): Innovating with AR through its YourHome app.,"This pattern is a fundamental tool for success today, especially in B2C retail. It is useful if you can reliably codify product information online. In B2B, it helps improve cost efficiency. It offers opportunities to exploit big data."
Experience Selling,The value of a standard product is augmented by an additional encompassing experience (WHAT?). The company actively shapes the customer's environment to differentiate itself (HOW?). Successful deployment leads to greater loyalty and increases willingness to pay higher prices (VALUE?).,The concept was popularized by Pine and Gilmore in 1998. Harley-Davidson (1903) successfully associated its brand with an emotional experience of freedom and adventure.,"Starbucks (1971): Created a unique ""third place"" experience. Red Bull (1987): Markets its drink by associating it with extreme sports. Amazon (2015, 2018): Uses Experience Selling in its physical stores by integrating digital services. NIO (2014): Built a lifestyle ecosystem (""NIO house"") around its electric cars.","Highly relevant for the retail industry and other sectors facing market saturation. It is useful for companies seeking to forge a direct, emotional bond with their customers and significantly differentiate their brand."
Flat Rate,Customers pay a single fixed lump sum for unlimited consumption of a product or service (WHAT?). The model is profitable if heavy users are balanced by those who use the service sparingly (VALUE?). The company benefits from a reliable revenue stream.,"The ""all you can eat"" concept (1946) is an early application. Swiss Federal Railways introduced an annual season ticket in 1898. Sandals Resorts (1981) pioneered ""all-inclusive"" vacation packages.","Netflix (1999): Offers unlimited streaming access for a fixed monthly fee. Spotify (2006): Combines Flat Rate with Freemium for ad-free, unlimited access. Sony PlayStation Now (2014): A monthly subscription for unlimited access to a library of games. Apple Arcade (2019): A game Flat Rate service.",Works well if the business has manageable marginal costs or if customers experience diminishing marginal utility with increased consumption. Appropriate if fixed billing is more cost-efficient than per-use billing.
Fractional Ownership,"Customers purchase only a part of a capital-intensive asset. This allows them to access expensive products they might otherwise be unable to afford (WHAT?). A management company often handles maintenance and reservations (HOW?). For the seller, this model opens access to a wider customer base, often resulting in higher total revenues (WHO?, VALUE?).",The roots are in collective farming in early 20th-century Russia. NetJets (1960s) pioneered the modern concept by selling fractional ownership of aircraft. The tourism industry popularized timeshares.,"Crowdhouse (2015) and Yielders (2016): Use fractional ownership for real estate investments. Masterworks (2017): Applies the model to high-value art masterpieces. Shared investments are growing for expensive, specialized machines in manufacturing.",This model is viable in industries involving capital-intensive assets where customers are willing to share usage rights. It is effective for opening up markets to customers who cannot afford the full asset price.
Franchising,"The franchisor sells independent entrepreneurs (franchisees) the right to use their proven business model. This allows the franchisor to expand rapidly with limited resources and risk (HOW?, VALUE?). Franchisees benefit from a successful brand and established processes (WHAT?). The franchisor generates revenue through fees and ongoing royalties.",Originated in medieval France. Singer Corporation (1851) used it to license sewing machine distribution.

Marriott International (1967): Manages and franchises hotel properties. Natur House (1992): Licenses its brand for dietary advice centers. Holcim Indonesia's Solusi Rumah (2006): Provides franchisees with a one-stop housing solution.","Recommended for companies with strong core assets (brand, know-how) that want to achieve rapid growth with limited risk. Success requires maintaining standardization and providing continuous support."
Freemium,"The offering is divided into a free, basic version (WHAT?) and a paid premium version. The free version attracts a large customer base. Revenue (VALUE?) is generated by customers who convert to the premium version. The cost of the basic product must be near zero, as premium users cross-subsidize free users (VALUE?).","The term was coined in 2006. It was enabled by the Internet, which allows products to be reproduced at virtually no cost. Early examples include Hotmail (1996).","Skype (2003): Offers free VoIP calls, monetizing via paid credits to landlines. Spotify (2006): Offers free, ad-supported streaming, with a premium subscription removing ads. Dropbox (2007): Offers limited free cloud storage, charging for expansion. YouTube Premium (2018): Provides an ad-free experience for a fee.",Ideal for Internet-based businesses with marginal production costs near zero and where network effects exist. It's a good strategy for testing user acceptance of new software or business models.
From Push to Pull,"This model shifts the focus from pushing products onto the market to a demand-driven ""pull"" strategy where customer needs drive company processes (WHAT?, HOW?). This requires a flexible value chain (HOW?). The goal is to produce only what customers actively ask for, reducing inventory costs.","The concept originated in logistics. Toyota (1975) pioneered pull strategies with its Production System, using ""Kanban logistics"" to minimize inventory and respond rapidly to customer needs.","Geberit (2000): Shifted its focus from selling to wholesalers to targeting construction decision-makers directly. Zara (1975): Uses its flexible production model to quickly design and distribute new collections based on trends. Amazon (2007, CreateSpace/KDP): Applied a pull strategy to book publishing, only printing books on demand.",Appropriate for challenging the entire value chain and eliminating waste. Ideal for manufacturing firms with high inventory costs. Success requires willingness to engage customers and high flexibility from suppliers.
Guaranteed Availability,"The company ensures nearly zero downtime of its technical products (WHAT?). This is typically delivered via a Flat Rate (#15) contract covering support, maintenance, and repair (HOW?). Customers value the stability, which helps them minimize downtime costs. The provider leverages its expertise to achieve high availability at lower operational costs (VALUE?).","The philosophy dates back to ancient China. Modern application evolved from fleet management. Rolls-Royce (1980s) pioneered 'power-by-the-hour', selling engine performance per flying hour rather than the engine itself.","IBM (1995): Transformed into a service provider offering integrated solutions for maintaining customers' IT infrastructure. Hilti (2000): Launched Fleet Management for hammer drills, guaranteeing immediate replacement. MachineryLink (2000): Rents agricultural machinery, ensuring availability.","Ideal for industries where the availability of complex products is crucial, especially in B2B. It is a reliable pattern for securing large, long-term contracts and commanding a price premium for minimized risk."
Hidden Revenue,"The business offers a primary product that is free or low-priced (WHAT?), but its main income is generated from a third party (WHO?) that cross-finances the offering (VALUE?). The core logic is the separation of the customer from the revenue stream. A common application is advertising (HOW?).",Dates back to 17th-century bulletins financed by paid classifieds. The concept evolved into modern ad-funded media.,"JCDecaux (1964): Provides public ""street furniture"" to cities for free in exchange for exclusive advertising rights. Metro International (1995): Published free daily newspapers funded entirely by advertising. Google (1998): Provides free services but generates over 90% of its revenue from targeted advertising. Facebook (2004) and TikTok (2017): Rely heavily on tailored advertising.",Suitable for contexts where a company can attract a massive user base with a free offering and commercialize that audience via a third party. Extremely popular in digital contexts for advertising and data trading.
Ingredient Branding,"A supplier brands a product (ingredient) that is a crucial part of another company's final product (HOW?). The ingredient is advertised as a notable feature, creating ""a brand within a brand"". This drives demand from end customers. The goal is a win-win scenario (WHAT?) where the ingredient enhances the final product's desirability.",Used since the mid-20th century. DuPont de Nemours (1802) established its Teflon brand as synonymous with high quality in final products like frying pans.,"W.L. Gore & Associates (Gore) (1958): Successfully branded its Gore-Tex membrane, partnering with numerous textile companies. Intel (1991): Launched ""Intel Inside,"" paying PC manufacturers to advertise its microprocessors. Bosch (2000): Leverages its reputation for quality to be visibly incorporated into final products. Sonos (2019): Provided speakers as an ingredient for IKEA's Symfonisk line.",Ideal for high-quality products that have high brand awareness. It works best when the ingredient is complementary to the final product. It allows the supplier to attract demand without manufacturing the final product itself.
Integrator,"The company controls a majority of the value chain steps (vertical integration), from sourcing raw materials to distribution (HOW?). This reduces dependency on suppliers, improving efficiency and decreasing costs (HOW?, VALUE?). It enables faster reaction times to market changes (VALUE?).",Emerged during industrialization. Carnegie Steel (1870) integrated iron ore mines and a proprietary railway network.

Suitable if the perceived value from integration outweighs the disadvantages of reduced specialization. Useful if customers demand one-stop solutions.
Layer Player,The company specializes by focusing on one or a few select activities within a value chain (HOW?). It applies this specialized expertise across a variety of independent markets (WHAT?). Layer Players benefit from economies of scale and superior efficiency. They often serve Orchestrators (#34) who outsource non-core activities.,"Developed in the 1970s. Early examples include specialized IT outsourcing providers in India, such as Wipro Technologies (1980).",DHL (1969): Focuses solely on delivery and distribution for a multitude of online retailers. Dennemeyer (1962): Specializes entirely in Intellectual Property (IP) management services. TRUSTe (1997): Focuses on data privacy management services. PayPal (1998): Focuses on online payment processing across various industries.,Suitable for companies aiming to maximize specialization and become a leader in their core area. It works if the company can readily transfer specialized skills and knowledge learned in one industry to others.
Leverage Customer Data,"This model centers on using customer data as a profitable resource. The company collects and processes vast data quantities through techniques like data mining and AI (HOW?). The derived knowledge is used internally to optimize offerings or enable targeted advertising, or sold to third parties (HOW?, VALUE?).","Developed starting in the 1980s, driven by advances in information management. Early CRM systems were improved through data from loyalty programs.","Amazon (1994): Analyzes sales data to provide personalized recommendations.

It is particularly effective when complemented by the Hidden Revenue model (#21). Success depends on navigating data privacy regulations."
Licensing,"The company focuses on developing intellectual property (IP) and then licensing the rights to third parties (HOW?). This generates predictable revenue streams (VALUE?) without the costs of production or marketing (HOW?). License fees are typically lower than outright sales, but the product diffuses more quickly, increasing brand recognition (VALUE?).",Traces back to the Middle Ages. Anheuser-Busch (1870) licensed its name to merchandise manufacturers. Walt Disney (1928) used Licensing extensively for the Mickey Mouse character.,"IBM (1920s): Licenses out its patented technologies, generating around $1.1 billion annually.

It provides an option to monetize products or technologies that are not central to the company’s core business. It is a powerful tool for increasing global distribution and brand awareness.
Lock-In,Customers are confined to a vendor's world of products in a way that makes switching to a competitor incur substantial costs. The vendor eliminates interoperability with the competition (HOW?) to ensure future repeat purchases (VALUE?). Dependencies can be established through technological restrictions or contractual obligations (HOW?).,Legal Lock-In dates back to the Roman Empire. Gillette (1904) used a combination of technology (razor handles only fitting Gillette blades) and patents to lock customers into buying high-margin consumables.,LEGO (1949): Uses a patented system of interlocking parts that are incompatible with competitors' products. Nespresso (1986): Uses proprietary coffee machines and capsules to compel continuous consumable purchases. Apple (1976): Locks users into its ecosystem through a shared operating system and synchronization services.,Highly effective when combined with the Razor and Blade model (#39). Suitable for companies that can protect their after-sales or spare-part businesses through technological means.
Long Tail,The model focuses on selling a massive range of niche products in small quantities (WHAT?). The total revenue from these low-volume sales can equal or exceed that of blockbuster products (VALUE?). Customers benefit from a broad and specialized selection (WHAT?). Success requires keeping the marginal cost of selling niche products low (HOW?).,"Popularized by Chris Anderson in 2006, enabled by the Internet, which removed physical distribution constraints. Amazon (1994) and eBay (1995) were early pioneers.","Netflix (1999): Offers over 100,000 film and TV titles. Grameen Bank (1983): Applied the principle to finance, targeting millions of impoverished people with microfinance. YouTube (2005): Hosts millions of user-uploaded videos, allowing access to a massive variety of content.",Promising if a company can efficiently manage complexity. Highly applicable for specialized or individualized offerings. The ability to successfully manage back-end processes for high product diversity is paramount.
Make More of It,"A company utilizes its internal know-how, core competencies, or surplus resources and offers them externally as a service (WHAT?, HOW?). This monetizes ""slack"" resources and generates additional revenue (VALUE?). The acquired expertise can be reinvested to improve internal processes (HOW?). Providing external services also builds the company's reputation (VALUE?).",Porsche (1931) pioneered this by creating Porsche Engineering Group to contract out its R&D expertise. Sulzer and MTU adopted similar strategies to finance R&D.,"Festo Group (1970): Formalized its internal training systems as Festo Didactic, selling educational products globally. BASF (1998): Uses its Verbund production sites to efficiently use and sell production residuals. Siemens Management Consulting (SMC) (1996): Leverages internal consulting expertise by offering services to external companies.","Applicable when unique core competencies can be leveraged into new market opportunities. Before proceeding, the company must identify which technologies and skills can be successfully transferred."
Mass Customisation,"This model reconciles mass production with individualized customization. It involves customizing products to specific customer needs while maintaining high efficiency (WHAT?, VALUE?). This is achieved through modular product architectures that can be combined in many ways (HOW?). Customers receive bespoke products without a substantial price premium (WHAT?).",Historically struggled with financial feasibility until computer-aided manufacturing in the 1990s enabled efficient modular production. Dell (1984) was one of the first to apply this successfully with customized PCs.,"Premium automotive manufacturers: Offer extensive customizable options. Adidas (2000, Miadidas) and Nike (2000, Nike by you): Allow customers to customize shoes and apparel online. mymuesli (2007): Allows customers to compose their own breakfast cereal.",Addresses the growing demand for personalized products. It can be applied to all industries. Success relies on having robust back-end systems capable of managing the complexity of diverse orders efficiently.
No Frills,"The company drastically trims down the value proposition to its minimum core elements (WHAT?), eliminating superfluous services. The resulting cost savings are passed on to the customer via lower prices (WHAT?). The goal is to attract a massive audience with lower purchasing power (WHO?). Success requires relentless cost minimization (HOW?).",Henry Ford (1908) was a pioneer when he introduced the Model T at half the market price by enforcing large-scale manufacturing and minimal customization.,"Southwest Airlines (1971): Launched the low-cost carrier model, eliminating amenities like meals. Aldi (1913): Reduces prices by limiting selection and store décor. McDonald’s (1948): Radically reduced its menu and introduced self-service.

It is essential that the company can realize economies of scale through standardization. Highly relevant in emerging markets (frugal products). The motto is: ""Less is more!""."
Open Business,"The company opens its internal value creation processes (like R&D) to external partners (HOW?). This creates a mutually beneficial ecosystem where partners engage in independently gainful activities (VALUE?). The goal is to gain new market shares and improve efficiency by leveraging external resources (HOW?, VALUE?).","Closely linked to Henry Chesbrough’s ""Open Innovation"" concept (2006). Procter & Gamble (P&G) (2000) formalized this with its Connect + Develop program, actively seeking external ideas.","IBM (1995): Reduced development costs by 80% by actively participating in the Linux Open Source system. Valve Corporation (1998): Created an ecosystem around its games, allowing external developers to create modifications.

The concept also forms the basis for platforms like Hyperledger and Ethereum.",Highly applicable in software design and technology-intensive fields. It allows companies to gain a competitive advantage by setting standards and creating a dedicated user community.
Orchestrator,The company defines its core competencies and outsources virtually all other activities (HOW?). The Orchestrator's core competence lies in coordinating these external partners. This is offset by benefiting from the partners’ specialized skills (VALUE?). Focusing on core strengths increases performance and reduces costs.,"Developed in the 1970s as globalization drove companies to outsource production. Nike (1978) pioneered this by outsourcing 98% of its production to Asia to focus on R&D, design, and marketing.","Airtel (1995): Outsourced major parts of its value chain to focus on core competencies. Li & Fung (1971): Manages a global network of over 10,000 suppliers without owning a single factory. Richelieu (1862): Specializes only in manufacturing food products that are sold by other companies.",Ideal if the company is involved in many steps of the value chain but needs to focus on its key strengths. Outsourcing reduces costs and increases flexibility. Success depends on the ability to actively manage diverse partners.
Pay Per Use,"The customer pays for a product or service based on its actual, metered usage (WHAT?) rather than a fixed rate. The customer is billed based on units used or duration (VALUE?). Customers are attracted by the flexibility and transparency of costs (WHAT?).",Rentals have historically been charged pro rata. The digitalization of media led to concepts like pay-per-view television.,"GoTo (1998): Introduced the pay-per-click model for Internet advertising.
